# Day 4

## Array Cardio Day 1

This is the solution to the [fourth day challenge](https://javascript30.com/) which is the Array Cardio Day 1 exercise.

In the main.js file you can see that I put Wes Bos's solution and at the bottom you can see my own answer some are correct, others have different code but same output and there, I have two wrong answers in number 5 and number 6 so in total I got 6/8 NOT BAD!ü§ì

## Challenge and Process

This is my own words of challenge and my process.

- Answer everything first before watching the video
- Understand the given questions
- Research the methods syntax and description if not known
- Code short as much as possible and use ES6 arrow function

## Favorite Code

```js
//* My answer on number 8, I got this on stackoverflow and I got to apply these in my answer as well as much shorter than Wes Bos' answer.

const counts = {};
data.forEach((x) => {
  counts[x] = (counts[x] || 0) + 1;
  //console.log(counts);
});
console.log(counts);
```

## What I Learned

Today, I am confident that my analysis skill has improved to the level that I can handle problems even if it is difficult and I have better understood the concept of JavaScript ES6.
