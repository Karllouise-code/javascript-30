# Day 7

## Array Cardio Day 2

This is the solution to the [seventh day challenge](https://javascript30.com/) which is the Array Cardio Day 1 exercise.

In the main.js file you can see that I put Wes Bos's solution and at the bottom you can see my own answer some are correct, others have different code but same output.

## Challenge and Process

This is my own words of challenge and my process.

- Answer everything first before watching the video
- Understand the given questions
- Research the methods syntax and description if not known
- Code short as much as possible and use ES6 arrow function

## What I Learned

Day 7 - I got to improve again my skill in analyzing the problem and solve it in my own way and because of that I am happy because my knowledge of javascript has increased again.
